class Energy(with_metaclass(NiftyMeta, type('NewBase', (Loggable, object), {}))):
    """ Provides the functional used by minimization schemes.

   The Energy object is an implementation of a scalar function including its
   gradient and curvature at some position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    position : Field
        The input parameter of the scalar function.

    Attributes
    ----------
    position : Field
        The Field location in parameter space where value, gradient and
        curvature are evaluated.
    value : np.float
        The value of the energy functional at given `position`.
    gradient : Field
        The gradient at given `position` in parameter direction.
    curvature : LinearOperator, callable
        A positive semi-definite operator or function describing the curvature
        of the potential at the given `position`.

    Notes
    -----
    An instance of the Energy class is defined at a certain location. If one
    is interested in the value, gradient or curvature of the abstract energy
    functional one has to 'jump' to the new position using the `at` method.
    This method returns a new energy instance residing at the new position. By
    this approach, intermediate results from computing e.g. the gradient can
    safely be reused for e.g. the value or the curvature.

    Memorizing the evaluations of some quantities (using the memo decorator)
    minimizes the computational effort for multiple calls.
