class Space(DomainObject):
    """ The abstract base class for all NIFTy spaces.

    An instance of a space contains information about the manifolds
    geometry and enhances the functionality of DomainObject by methods that
    are needed for powerspectrum analysis and smoothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Attributes
    ----------
    dim : np.int
        Total number of dimensionality, i.e. the number of pixels.
    harmonic : bool
        Specifies whether the space is a signal or harmonic space.
    total_volume : np.float
        The total volume of the space.
    shape : tuple of np.ints
        The shape of the space's data array.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        Raised if instantiated directly.

    Notes
    -----
    `Space` is an abstract base class. In order to allow for instantiation
    the methods `total_volume` and `copy` must be implemented as well as the
    abstract methods inherited from `DomainObject`.

        This method, which is only implemented for harmonic spaces, helps

        its harmonic space. The returned function multiplies field values of a
        field with a zero centered Gaussian which corresponds to a convolution
        with a Gaussian kernel and sigma standard deviation in position space.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sigma : float
            A real number representing a physical scale on which the smoothing
            takes place. The smoothing is defined with respect to the real
            physical field and points that are closer together than one sigma
            are blurred together. Mathematically sigma is the standard
            deviation of a convolution with a normalized, zero-centered
            Gaussian that takes place in position space.

        Returns
        -------
        function (array-like -> array-like)
            A smoothing operation that multiplies values with a Gaussian
            kernel.
