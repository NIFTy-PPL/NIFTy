Some remarks on NIFTy's treatment of random numbers

NIFTy makes use of the `Generator` and `SeedSequence` classes introduced to
`numpy.random` in numpy 1.17.

On first load of the `nifty.cl.random` module, it creates a stack of
`SeedSequence` objects which contains a single `SeedSequence` with a fixed seed,
and also a stack of `Generator` objects, which contains a single generator
derived from the above seed sequence. Without user intervention, this generator
will be used for all random number generation tasks within NIFTy. This means

- that random numbers drawn by NIFTy will be reproducible across multiple runs
  (assuming there are no complications like MPI-enabled runs with a varying
  number of tasks), and

- that trying to change random seeds via `numpy.random.seed` will have no
  effect on the random numbers drawn by NIFTy.

Users who want to change the random seed for a given run can achieve this
by calling :func:`push_sseq_from_seed()` with a seed of their choice. This will
push a new seed sequence generated from that seed onto the seed sequence stack,
and a generator derived from this seed sequence onto the generator stack.
Since all NIFTy RNG-related calls will use the generator on the top of the stack,
all calls from this point on will use the new generator.
If the user already has a `SeedSequence` object at hand, they can pass this to
NIFTy via :func:`push_sseq`. A new generator derived from this sequence will then
also be pushed onto the generator stack.
These operations can be reverted (and should be, as soon as the new generator is
no longer needed) by a call to :func:`pop_sseq()`.
When users need direct access to the RNG currently in use, they can access it
via the :func:`current_rng` function.


Example for using multiple seed sequences:

Assume that N samples are needed to compute a KL, which are distributed over
a variable number of MPI tasks. In this situation, whenever random numbers
need to be drawn for these samples:

- each MPI task should spawn as many seed sequences as there are samples
  *in total*, using ``sseq = spawn_sseq(N)``

- each task loops over the local samples

  - first pushing the seed sequence for the **global** index of the
    current sample via ``push_sseq(sseq[iglob])```

  - drawing the required random numbers

  - then popping the seed sequence again via ``pop_sseq()``

That way, random numbers should be reproducible and independent of the number
of MPI tasks.

WARNING: do not push/pop the same `SeedSequence` object more than once - this
will lead to repeated random sequences! Whenever you have to push `SeedSequence`
objects, generate new ones via :func:`spawn_sseq()`.
