    numerical inversion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    op : :class:`EndomorphicOperator`
        The operator to be enhanced.
        The InversionEnabler object will support the same operation modes as
        `op`, and additionally the inverse set. The newly-added modes will
        be computed by iterative inversion.
    iteration_controller : :class:`IterationController`
        The iteration controller to use for the iterative numerical inversion
        done by a :class:`ConjugateGradient` object.
    approximation : :class:`LinearOperator`, optional
        if not None, this operator should be an approximation to `op`, which
        supports the operation modes that `op` doesn't have. It is used as a
        preconditioner during the iterative inversion, to accelerate
        convergence.
