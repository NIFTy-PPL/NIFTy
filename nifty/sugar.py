    """ Creates a diagonal operator with the given power spectrum.

    Constructs a diagonal operator that lives over the specified domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    domain : DomainObject
        Domain over which the power operator shall live.
    power_spectrum : (array-like, method)
        An array-like object, or a method that implements the square root
        of a power spectrum as a function of k.
    dtype : type *optional*
        dtype that the field holding the power spectrum shall use
        (default : None).
        if dtype == None: the dtype of `power_spectrum` will be used.
    distribution_strategy : string *optional*
        Distributed strategy to be used by the underlying d2o objects.
        (default : 'not')

    Returns
    -------
    DiagonalOperator : An operator that implements the given power spectrum.
