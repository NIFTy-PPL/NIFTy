What is NIFTy.re?
-----------------

**NIFTy**, "\ **N**\umerical **I**\nformation **F**\ield **T**\heor\ **y**\ ", is a Bayesian imaging library.
It is designed to infer the million to billion dimensional posterior distribution in the image space from noisy input data.
At the core of NIFTy lies a set of powerful Gaussian Process (GP) models and accurate Variational Inference (VI) algorithms.
This document gives a short summary on the NIFTy.re implementation.
In the following, an online version of the latest publication describing NIFTy.re is provided.
The publication gives a quick overview of the core concepts powering NIFTy.re.
Furthermore we showcases simple examples, and demonstrate the Correlated field model in NIFTy.re.
