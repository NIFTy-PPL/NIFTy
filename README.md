**NIFTy**, "**N**umerical **I**nformation **F**ield **T**heor<strong>y</strong>",
is a Bayesian inference library.  It is designed to compute statistical
properties of high-dimensional posterior probability distributions (tested up to
billions of parameters) from noisy input data.  At the core of NIFTy lies a set
of Gaussian Process (GP) models and Variational Inference (VI) algorithms - in
particular Metric Gaussian Variational Inference (MGVI) and Geometric Gaussian
Variational Inference (geoVI).

There are two independent implementation variants of NIFTy:

- [Re-envisioned NIFTy](#niftyre) (`nifty.re`)
- [Classical NIFTy](#niftycl) (`nifty.cl`)

These variants share lots of functionality:

- Similar VI algorithms
- Similar GP models
- Similar interfaces (e.g., `nifty.cl/re.optimize_kl` and
  `nifty.cl/re.CorrelatedFieldMaker`)
- Both can run on CPUs and GPUs

The major differences between them are:

- Philosophy: `nifty.cl` provides hackable transparent building blocks to
  explore discretization-independent Bayesian inference algorithms with minimal
  dependencies. On the other hand, `nifty.re` is built around JAX, provides a
  more direct numpy-like interface and aims for high performance out of the box.
- Backend: numpy/cupy (`nifty.cl`) vs JAX (`nifty.re`).
- Performance: `nifty.re` leverages JIT from JAX and thereby runs generally
  faster than `nifty.cl`.
- Functionality: `nifty.re` supports HMC and Multi Grids. `nifty.cl` does not
  (yet).
- API: In `nifty.cl` algorithms are implemented independent of the chosen
  discretization scheme represented explicitly by `nifty.cl.Domain`s. `nifty.re`
  provides more direct access to arrays.
- License: `nifty.cl` is distributed under GPL-3.0+. `nifty.re` is distributed
  under BSD-2-Clause or GPL-2.0+.

For a quick start, you can browse through the [informal introduction](https://ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty/user/)
or dive into NIFTy by running the scrips in the demos folder.  The subfolders
`cl/` and `re/` contain the scripts relevant for the respective NIFTy flavor.






## NIFTy.re

### Installation

NIFTy is distributed on PyPI. For a minimal installation of `nifty.re` run:
```
pip install --user 'nifty[re]'
```

To install NIFTy.re with GPU support please manually install JAX following the instructions in the [JAX installation guid](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html).

If you might want to adapt the NIFTy source code, we suggest installing NIFTy as editable python package with a command such as:

```
git clone -b nifty https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/ift/nifty.git
cd nifty
pip install --user --editable '.[re]'
```

### Run the tests

To run the tests, install all optional requirements `'nifty[all]'` and afterwards run pytest (and create a coverage report) via

```
pytest -n auto --cov=nifty test
```

If you are writing your own tests, it is often sufficient to just install the optional test dependencies `'nifty[test]'`. However, to run the full test suit including tests of optional functionality, it is assumed that all optional dependencies are installed.

### Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!
Feel free to reach out early on in the development process e.g. by opening a draft PR or filing an issue, we are happy to help in the development and provide feedback along the way.
Please open an issue first if you think your PR changes current code substantially.
Please format your code according to the existing style used in the file or with black for new files.
To advertise your changes, please update the public documentation and the ChangeLog if your PR affects the public API.
Please add appropriate tests to your PR.

## NIFTy.cl

`nifty.cl` is a versatile library designed to enable the development of signal
inference algorithms that operate regardless of the underlying grids (spatial,
spectral, temporal, …) and their resolutions.  Its object-oriented framework is
written in Python, although it accesses libraries written in C++ and C for
efficiency.

NIFTy offers a toolkit that abstracts discretized representations of continuous
spaces, fields in these spaces, and operators acting on these fields into
classes.
This allows for an abstract formulation and programming of inference algorithms,
including those derived within information field theory.  NIFTy's interface is
designed to resemble IFT formulae in the sense that the user implements
algorithms in NIFTy independent of the topology of the underlying spaces and the
discretization scheme.
Thus, the user can develop algorithms on subsets of problems and on spaces where
the detailed performance of the algorithm can be properly evaluated and then
easily generalize them to other, more complex spaces and the full problem,
respectively.

The set of spaces on which NIFTy operates comprises point sets, *n*-dimensional
regular grids, spherical spaces, their harmonic counterparts, and product spaces
constructed as combinations of those.  NIFTy takes care of numerical subtleties
like the normalization of operations on fields and the numerical representation
of model components, allowing the user to focus on formulating the abstract
inference procedures and process-specific model properties.

### Dependencies and installation

The latest version of `nifty.cl` can be installed from the sources:

    pip install git+https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/ift/nifty@nifty

Releases can be found on PyPI:

    pip install nifty

Both will install the basic required dependencies (numpy and scipy). Often users
may choose to install optional dependencies to enable additional features.

- `ducc0`: Use FFTs directly from ducc and enable several operators implemented
  directly in C++ for speed.
- `cupy`: Enable GPU backend.
- `pyvkfft`: Use vkFFT instead of cufft.
- `mpi4py`: Parallelize computations via MPI.
- `astropy`: Save certain outputs as FITS files.
- `h5py`: Save certain outputs as HDF5 files.
- `matplotlib`: Enable plotting, e.g., via `nifty.cl.Plot`.

### First Steps

For a quick start, you can browse through the [informal
introduction](https://ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty/user/code.html) or dive into
NIFTy by running one of the demonstrations, e.g.:

    python3 demos/cl/getting_started_1.py

### Testing

To run the tests `pytest` is required. The tests can be run using the following
command in the repository root:

    pytest test/test_cl

To run the full test suit including tests of optional functionality, it is
assumed that all optional dependencies are installed.

## Building the Documentation

NIFTy's documentation is generated via [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) and is available online at [ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty](https://ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty/).

To build the documentation locally, run:

```
sudo apt-get install dvipng jupyter-nbconvert texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra
pip install --user sphinx==8.1.3 jupytext pydata-sphinx-theme myst-parser sphinxcontrib-bibtex
cd <nifty_directory>
bash docs/generate.sh
```

To view the documentation, open `docs/build/index.html` in your browser.

Note: Make sure that you reinstall nifty after each change since sphinx imports nifty from the Python path.
