class SamplingEnabler(EndomorphicOperator):
    """Class which acts as a operator object built of (`likelihood` + `prior`)
    and enables sampling from its inverse even if the operator object
    itself does not support it.


    Parameters
    ----------
    likelihood : :class:`EndomorphicOperator`
        Metric of the likelihood
    prior : :class:`EndomorphicOperator`
        Metric of the prior
    iteration_controller : :class:`IterationController`
        The iteration controller to use for the iterative numerical inversion
        done by a :class:`ConjugateGradient` object.
    approximation : :class:`LinearOperator`, optional
        if not None, this linear operator should be an approximation to the
        operator, which supports the operation modes that the operator doesn't
        have. It is used as a preconditioner during the iterative inversion,
        to accelerate convergence.
    start_from_zero : boolean
        If true, the conjugate gradient algorithm starts from a field filled
        with zeros. Otherwise, it starts from a prior samples. Default is
        False.
