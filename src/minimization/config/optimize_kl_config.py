class OptimizeKLConfig:
    """Plug config files into ift.optimize_kl.

    If you use this class for the first time, look at an example config file
    (e.g. `demos/getting_started_7_config_file.cfg`) before continuing to read
    the documentation.

    After parsing the config file the following steps are taken:

    - All `base` entries are interpreted. The options that are written out
      explicitly in a given section override what might be imported via a `base`
      entry. `base` inheritance does not work recursively (yet?).
    - Repetitions (e.g. "2*5,3*2") in `optimization.*` are expanded and replaced
      by an explicit list (e.g. "5,5,2,2,2"). The length of the resulting list
      is not allowed to be  longer than `total iterations`. If it is shorter,
      the last value is repeated.
    - All optimization stages (`optimization.*`) are joined into a single stage
      (`optimization.0`). For this, the quantity after the point `.` in
      `optimization.*` is interpreted as `int` and sorted afterwards. This means
      that for example `optimization.02` comes after `optimization.-1`. E.g.
      `optimization.1.1` is not allowed.

    For referring to e.g. likelihood energy operators, the star `*` is used as
    dereferencing operator. The value after the `*` refers to a section in the
    config file that must be instantiable via `OptimizeKLConfig.instantiate_section(key)`.

    Generally, all spaces (` `) in keys are internally replaced by underscores
    (`_`) such that they can be used in function calls.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config_parser : ConfigParser
        ConfigParser that contains all configuration.
    builders : dict
        Dictionary of functions that are used to instantiate e.g. operators.

    Example
    -------
    For an example of a typical config file, look at
    `demos/getting_started_7_config_file.cfg` in the nifty repository.

    Note
    ----
    Not treated by this class: export_operator_outputs, initial_position,
    initial_index, comm, inspect_callback, terminate_callback,
    return_final_position, resume

    Note
    ----
    Make sure that ConfigParser is case-sensitive by setting its attribute
    `optionxform` to `str` before parsing.
